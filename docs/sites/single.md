## Single Site

Out of the box, Timestrap is a single site using the fake domain `time.strap`
and name `Timestrap`. If there is no need for multiple sites, simply 
manipulate the configuration for this initial site. Any domain will fall back
to this default site, but it is recommended that at least the site domain 
setting be updated to match the actual site domain.
