# Timestrap

Time tracking and invoicing you can host anywhere. Full export support in
multiple formats and easily extensible.

### Warning

This app is currently very unstable as I have just started coding it.
Everything may, and probably will, change.

## Quickstart

Want to get up and running quickly?

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/overshard/timestrap)

We create a default username and password with superuser access to get you
started, please change it via the admin panel:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `changeme123`

If you are manually deploying to Heroku without using the deploy button make
sure you create two settings before pushing using `heroku config:set`:

    heroku config:set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=timestrap.settings.heroku
    heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=ChangeMeToSomethingRandom

You will also need to create a superuser after your push has been successful in
order to login:

    heroku run python manage.py createsuperuser


## Demo Website

I've setup an [instance on Heroku](https://timestrap.herokuapp.com/) of
Timestrap that resets every 10 minutes if you want to play with it. The
username and password are set to the same as the Quickstart ones. If someone
messes up the fun for everyone wait till the next reset or start your own
Heroku instance.
