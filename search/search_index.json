Full export support in multiple formats and easily extensible. Warning \u00b6 This app is currently very unstable. Everything may, and probably will, change. All migrations are going to be wiped and setup properly before release 1.0 so you will not be able to upgrade to 1.0 from early development. Documentation \u00b6 For more details and screenshots check out our main docs website: https://docs.gettimestrap.com/ Demo \u00b6 There is a demo instance of Timestrap on Heroku that resets every 10 minutes. Superuser Credentials \u00b6 All installations and the demo create a superuser to get you started, if this is a production deployment you will want to change these. Username: admin Password: admin Heroku Installation \u00b6 The easiest way to run Timestrap and the only installation that I can actively support since I use it myself in production. For manual deployments to Heroku, make sure to create two environmental variables before pushing using heroku config:set : heroku config:set DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=timestrap.settings.heroku heroku config:set SECRET_KEY=ChangeMeToSomethingRandom Docker Installation \u00b6 This creates a minimal docker server setup for Timestrap. This currently is in development and may not have persistent data without fiddling. Any help to improve the docker configuration files would be appreciated. Docker Requirements \u00b6 Docker Docker Compose Docker Compose is used for running multiple containers since we require a PostgreSQL database and, not yet but soon, a Redis server for messages and events. Docker Running \u00b6 Make sure to update the environmental variables in docker-compose.yml and check the timestrap/settings/docker.py file to see if you'd like to change anything then run: sudo docker-compose up --detach To migrate the database, create your first superuser, and create the initial site configuration you then need to run: sudo docker-compose exec web python3 manage.py migrate --settings=timestrap.settings.docker The Timestrap application should now be running on port 80 of whatever system you ran these commands on, if you ran this locally then that would be http://localhost/ . Docker Data \u00b6 All data should be stored in the timestrap_db volume. If you wish to rebuild Timestrap at the latest you can do the following from the timestrap repo you cloned: git pull sudo docker-compose stop sudo docker-compose build sudo docker-compose up --detach sudo docker-compose exec web python3 manage.py migrate --settings=timestrap.settings.docker All data will be kept during this process and you'll have the latest version of Timestrap. Development Installation \u00b6 If you'd like to contribute code to Timestrap you'll need to do this! Development Requirements \u00b6 Python 3.5+ Python Dev Node 8+ pipenv npm Firefox geckodriver Python 3.5+ is required because we use async/await with Channels to support WebSockets and add realtime updates to the client. Python Dev is not required on macOS but if you are on Linux, like Ubuntu, you will need to install it with sudo apt install python3-dev . Node 8+ isn't exactly required, you might be able to get away with an older version and we only use node for building the client. You'll probably need to install pipenv with pip, run pip install pipenv to get this. It's just a better python package manager that allows us to lock our dependencies. Node installs npm by default but you may want to install the latest with npm install --global npm . Firefox is used for functional/selenium tests in conjunction with geckodriver, you can get geckodriver from mozilla's offical releases or you might be able to install it with your systems package manager. Brew on macOS has this with brew install geckodriver . If you have to download it manually make sure to extract it in some sort of bin directory e.g. /usr/local/bin/ . Development Setup \u00b6 Once you have all of the above you can get started! For the global npm install on gulp-cli you may need to run this with sudo depending on how you installed everything above. npm install --global gulp-cli npm install pipenv install --dev After all the dependencies install you can migrate the database and run the server. gulp manage:migrate gulp If you'd like to have some sample data to work with you can run gulp manage:fake after you run gulp manage:migrate . Timestrap should now be running at http://localhost:8000 and gulp + django's test server will automatically recognize and recompile changes to any file allowing for quick modification and review. Once you've made your changes you can test with gulp coverage:development and if that is successful and you want to share your changes create a pull request ! Development Commands \u00b6 I've prebuilt a variety of build commands for development, you can see a list of them by running gulp --tasks and I will breifly cover some of them here. gulp Will run a webserver with django and build the client with webpack gulp lint Will check all code for style consistency gulp manage:makemigrations Will generate new migrations if models changes gulp manage:migrate Makes sure there is a superuser, runs migrations gulp manage:fake Adds a bunch of fake data for testing gulp manage:reset Resets the database and adds fake data with a superuser gulp coverage:development Lints, runs tests, shows coverage report","title":"Home"},{"location":"#timestrap","text":"Time tracking you can host anywhere.

On Heroku you can run heoku certs:auto:enable to get a free LetsEncrypt certificate. You will need to configure two settings when you use TLS/SSL on this project. The first is to force TLS/SSL when people visit your site and the second is to make sure that Django REST framework returns corrected URLs behind a reverse proxy.

Single Site \u00b6 Out of the box, Timestrap is a single site using the fake domain time.strap and name Timestrap . Both the name and the domain name are configurable on the admin. Any domain will fall back to the default site, but it is recommended to at least set the site domain setting be updated to match the actual site domain since emails will use this domain when sending. Multiple Sites \u00b6 Timestrap supports setting up multiple sites with configurations options available on a per-site basis. This functionality may be useful if, for example, there is a need to separate departments or functional teams within a larger group of organization. Sites can be managed by any user with admin access and appropriate permissions: either superuser or the various site and conf permissions. Sites are based on domain and use two primary settings, domain and name in addition to the various configuration options available. Data Sharing \u00b6 All Timestrap data will be related to either one or multiple sites. Clients and Tasks can be related to multiple sites. Entries can be related to a single site. Data with a single-site relationship will automatically be related to the site it was entered on. This settings can be changed from the admin site.
